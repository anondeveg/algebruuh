# algebruuh

A lightweight interpreter for mathematical equations.

## Status

🚧 **Early Development** - Currently implements lexical analysis ONLY. AST generation and evaluation are in progress.

## Note
The lexer and AST are things I’m building mostly by intuition right now. Both will be rewritten later in a more standard, industry-style way.
The whole purpose of the project is to have fun and learn.

## Prerequisites

- C/C++ compiler with make support
- Standard build tools (gcc/clang)

## Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anondeveg/algebruuh
cd algebruuh
make build | debug 
```

## Usage

```bash
algebruuh [OPTIONS] <PATH_TO_FILE>
```

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-v` | **Verbose mode** - Prints tokens as they are generated |
| `-d` | **Dump mode** - Exports token vector to `dump.lex` in the current directory |

### Example

Create a file with your equation:

```
# example.bruh
x + 2 - 120 + y^4 
```

Run the interpreter:

```bash
# Basic usage
algebruuh example.bruh

# With verbose output
algebruuh -v example.bruh

# Dump tokens 
algebruuh -d example.bruh
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Support multiple equations separated by newlines
- [ ] Implement AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) generation
- [ ] Add tree evaluation and equation solving
- [ ] Support for common mathematical functions
